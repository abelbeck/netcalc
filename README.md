IP network calculator
=====================

netcalc is a clone of [sipcalc][], which is an console based IP subnet
calculator with IPv4 and IPv6 support.

Sipcalc development started by Simon Ekstrand back in 2001 and has most
of the features needed in an IP calculator.  It is no longer in active
development.

This project is a slimmed down version of the sipcalc code base, using
the output format of [ipcalc][].  It is written in C and has very few
dependencies.
